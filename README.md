If it is inevitable to win then lose in a gradient with ultradice then there must be a consistent pattern, how is that possible if a range is selected according to a lesser case that is a temporal domain selected by hand? There indeed are deterministic forces at play. To exploit this find the cost stream on the cmd window relative to the selectivity of the differentiable dice window, and expect redundancy blocks, i.e win,win,win,win,lose,lose,lose,lose... works with 50/50
